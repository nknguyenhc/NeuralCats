# NeuralCats

Project submission for Microsoft AI Classroom Hackathon. More info on the hackathon can be found [here](https://microsoftaiclassroom.devpost.com/)

## Development

### Backend

1. Install the required Python requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Ensure that you have created an [Azure Language Resource](https://portal.azure.com/?quickstart=true#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesTextAnalytics).
3. Retrieve the endpoint and an API key from your Azure Language Resource. Put them into an `.env` file in the `backend` folder.
4. Ensure that you have created an [Custom Question Answering knowledge base](https://language.azure.com/).
5. Put the knowledge base name into the `.env` file in the `backend` folder.
6. Add `ENV` with value `development` to your `.env` file.
At this point, your `.env` file should look something like this:
```
ENDPOINT=https://{YOUR SERVICE ENDPOINT}.cognitiveservices.azure.com/
APIKEY={YOUR API KEY}
KNOWLEDGE_BASE={YOUR PROJECT NAME}
ENV=development
```
7. To test out the sample qna, modify the question in `index.py` and run `python index.py model-test`. Note that the answer you receive depends on the knowledge base that you have.
8. Run command `uvicorn index:app --reload` to start the development server.
9. Open `localhost:8000` in browser to confirm that the server is running.
10. To get currently available API, head to `localhost:8000/docs` (auto-generated by FastAPI).

**Folder structure**

* `model`: processes the query with the AI model, doing API call to Azure.
* `static`: static files, such as `.js` and `.css` files.
* `templates`: HTML files
* Other folders: each is responsible for a part of the backend.
  * `qna`: handles API calls related to QnA service.

### Frontend

1. Install libraries with `npm i`.
1. Start the frontend react server with `npm start`.

**Folder structure**

In `src`:
* `fetch`: dealing with API call. Currrently, this only deals with POST http calls.
* `router`: React router.
* `components`: store reusable components.
* `redux`: Redux states. Currently, Redux states contain the available NUS modules fetched from backend.

**Techstacks**

* [React](https://react.dev/)
* [Emotion CSS](https://emotion.sh/)
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)

Remember to add the following line to the start of every `.tsx` file for EmotionCSS styling: 

```javascript
/** @jsxImportSource @emotion/react */
```
